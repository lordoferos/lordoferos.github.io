## Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I'm a data enthusiast with a passion for open source projects and currently based in Kenya. I specialize in using R for data science and dabble in Python. I work at the World Agroforestry Centre as a data analyst in projects on [asset based community-driven development](https://www.cifor-icraf.org/abcd/), [agroecological transformation](https://www.cgiar.org/initiative/agroecology/) and developing [holistic metrics in agroecology](https://www.cgiar.org/news-events/news/the-measure-of-agroecology/) Driven by a love for maps and automation, I'm currently also building a dashboard to showcase demographic data in Kenya and creating statistical models to predict fire frequency. Connect with me on Twitter for all things data, mapping and open source!

## ðŸ‘‡ &nbsp;Current projects

I'm currently working on [Kenya Census](https://github.com/lordoferos/kenya_census) and [Hawaii](https://github.com/lordoferos/Hawaai). Working on a dashboard solution to display key metrics on specific administrative locations in Kenya. Also working on transferring most of my previous work that is offline to GitHub.
